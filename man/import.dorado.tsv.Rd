\title{Import the summary tsv into R and subset by type}
\usage{
import.dorado.tsv(file_or_directory)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_or_directory}{The path to a single duplex summary file or directory of duplex summary files.}
}
\value{
Depending upon input, either a list containing three dataframes: (1) Both duplex/simplex reads, (2) only duplex reads, (3) only simplex reads, OR if no duplex data is found, a single dataframe of simplex reads.
}
\description{
Dorado summary creates a summary.tsv which can be read into R using read.delim(<file>, header=T,na.strings=c("","NA")). However, this can only read a single dataframe at a time and for duplex reads, is not subset into smaller dataframes. 
For a single file: The function imports the data using read.delim as a dataframe.
For a directory of reads: The function imports each .tsv file as a dataframe index of a list, then binds the list into a single dataframe. 
If Duplex reads are found: The imported dataframe is converted into a list of (1) duplex/simplex reads, (2) duplex reads, (3) simplex reads. 
If no duplex reads are found, the script returns the respective dataframe of imported reads.
